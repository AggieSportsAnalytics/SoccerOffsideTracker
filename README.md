# Soccer Offside Tracker ‚öΩÔ∏è

### üèÅ Determine offsides from any angle using the help of computer vision.

The Offside Detection in Soccer project is an advanced computer vision application that aims to accurately determine whether a player is in an offside position during a soccer match. Offside is a crucial rule in soccer, and its correct interpretation can significantly impact the outcome of a game. The project leverages the power of Python and various computer vision techniques to automate the offside decision-making process, reducing the reliance on human judgment and minimizing the potential for errors.

# üîë Key Features
## Player Tracking
The project employs object detection and tracking algorithms to identify and track the positions of players on the field throughout the game.
- Uses YOLOv8 Object Detection: Bounding box, classes, and segmentation

***The small circle represents each players furthest body part. This is the point that is used for determining offsides***

*Note: Referee and Goalie are ignored*

## Team Color Segmentation
The system also analyzes the colors of the player jerseys to distinguish between teams. By detecting the dominant colors on the players' uniforms, the algorithm can categorize them into teams.

- Uses bounding box to determine which way the player is facing
- Creates a smaller box at the most likely spot of the player's jersey
- Gets the average color in the smaller box
- Uses euclidean distance to group players into 3 groups: team1, team2, and team3 (referees and goalkeepers)

## Perspective Transform onto 2D Map
The most important part of this project is implementing perspective transform to get information on the actual distance down the field players are. This information is crucial for making offside determinations.

- Uses OpenCV's perspective transform
- Passes in each players furthest positioning (including any head, body, and feet) and places it on a 2D map of the field
- Determines who is nearest to the goal line and highlights that player

# ü™¥ Areas of Improvement
- Reliability: The project could always have higher accuracy and reliability in offside decisions. It is only as accurate as the points it is given for perspective transform.
- Real-Time Video Analysis: The system would be more useful if it could process live video feeds from soccer matches, enabling real-time offside detection during gameplay.
- Pitch Detection: If the system could automatically detect and classify points on the field, the process would be entirely automated. This is a limitation created by non-fixed camera angles and could be solved with a fixed view of the field.
- Deep Sort: If players could be tracked throughout the game, we could implement automatic statistics on the amount of time spent offside.

# üöÄ Further Uses
- Team Formation Analysis: The project can further analyze the players' positions to determine the formation of each team during a particular play. This information can be valuable for understanding the dynamics of the game and how the offside decision impacts team strategies.
- Player Jersey Number Recognition: The system could utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to read the jersey numbers of players on the field. This allows the identification of individual players and track their movement and time spent offside.

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- YoloV8
