# Soccer Offside Tracker ‚öΩÔ∏è

### üèÅ Determine offsides from any angle using the help of computer vision.

The Offside Detection in Soccer project is an advanced computer vision application that aims to accurately determine whether a player is in an offside position during a soccer match. Offside is a crucial rule in soccer, and its correct interpretation can significantly impact the outcome of a game. The project leverages the power of Python and various computer vision techniques to automate the offside decision-making process, reducing the reliance on human judgment and minimizing the potential for errors.

In this example, it reveals that the Haiti player offside which VAR later revealed in the game.

## üîë Key Features
- Player Tracking: The project employs object detection and tracking algorithms to identify and track the positions of players on the field throughout the game. This information is crucial for making offside determinations.
- Team Color Segmentation: The system also analyzes the colors of the player jerseys to distinguish between teams. By detecting the dominant colors on the players' uniforms, the algorithm can categorize them into teams.
- Goalkeeper and Referee Exclusion: Goalkeepers and referees are easily recognized by their distinct attire. The system filters them out from the player detection results, ensuring that their positions do not interfere with the offside calculations.
- Reliability: The project emphasizes achieving high accuracy and reliability in offside decisions. It will determine outcomes better than the human eye by using mathematical models to trasform players onto a 2D surface
- Real-Time Video Analysis: The system can process live video feeds from soccer matches, enabling real-time offside detection during gameplay. It can also be applied to pre-recorded matches for analysis and review.

## üöÄ Further Uses
- Team Formation Analysis: The project can further analyze the players' positions to determine the formation of each team during a particular play. This information can be valuable for understanding the dynamics of the game and how the offside decision impacts team strategies.
- Player Jersey Number Recognition: The system could utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to read the jersey numbers of players on the field. This allows the identification of individual players and track their movement and time spent offside.
